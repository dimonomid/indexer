* Bugfix: background tags generation was fail on Windows 7. Now it's ok. (actually, i don't really understand why it was fail. On Linux and on Windows XP all works fine. I just found workaround to make it work on Win7 too) Thanks to Shi Haipend for bugreport.
* Some improvements in troubleshooting: added debug log and debug snapshot. ( TODO: read :help indexer-... )
