3.0

* Multiple projects supported. For example, you opened file1 from one project, and then you opened file2 from second project. Now, when you switch to file1, there's &tags for first project, and when you switch to file2, there's &tags for second project. You should not care about it.
* Background tags generation. You have not to wait every time until all tags becomes generated.
* By default, on Windows tags generates always for whole project, because of bugs in all Windows versions of Sed i have. Actually, now this isn't problem, because of tags generates in background.
* Tags file is sorted now. In Indexer 2.x it was unsorted because of bugs in Sed, and to make tags unsorted was workaround. As i already said, in Linux Sed works fine, and on Windows Sed doesn't uses by default, so, tags file can be sorted =).
