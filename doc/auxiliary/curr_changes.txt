*) Optimized work with .vimprojects file (with project.tar.gz plugin) on rather large projects: now, Indexer generates filelist, stores it into the file and passes it to ctags with "-L" key, instead of passing each file directly in command line. This makes ctags work much faster, because in earlier versions it was called several times with "-a" key if command is too long.
*) Optimized work with .indexer_files file: syntax of this file changed a bit, to make ctags settings much more effective. However, old syntax works too, for backward compatibility reasons. If you used Indexer before with .indexer_files, then I would strongly recommend you to read :help indexer-syn-change-4.10 .
*) Added syntax file for .indexer_files .
If you found a bug, please report it to me.
