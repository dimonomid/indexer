*) need to fix: if ctags becomes zombie just once, then indexer can't stop it and so it doesn't index anything until Vim is restarted. See todo/hgcommand.vim file - ctags becomes zombie if you try to generate tags for it

-*) exctags and others before ctags

-*) create stable version

-*) create one more value for g:indexer_ctagsDontSpecifyFilesIfPossible: -1, or maybe 2, and make it default.
   with this value, Indexer should behave with .vimprojects like value is 0, 
   and with .indexer_files like value is 1.
