*) refactor NeedSkipBuffer: it should not affect main Vimprj's NeedSkipBuffer.

*) add option to not to modify &path

*) include projects.
For instance, in module/old/.vimprj/appl/.vimprj/.indexer_files i'd like to
define something like that:

[Module_old]
$INDEXER_PROJECT_ROOT\**\*.[ch]
INCLUDE_PROJECT = vimprj(../../../lib/mc/ecan)

or:

[Module_old]
$INDEXER_PROJECT_ROOT\**\*.[ch]
INCLUDE_PROJECT = vimprj(../../../lib/mc/ecan), project_name(ecan)

or:

[Module_old]
$INDEXER_PROJECT_ROOT\**\*.[ch]
INCLUDE_PROJECT = project_name(some_another_project)

[some_another_project]
some_path/**/*.[ch]


*) need to fix: if ctags becomes zombie just once, then indexer can't stop it and so it doesn't index anything until Vim is restarted. See todo/hgcommand.vim file - ctags becomes zombie if you try to generate tags for it

*) If indexer gives every filename to ctags, there could be better to use -L
   key instead of put every filename to command

-*) exctags and others before ctags

-*) create stable version

-*) create one more value for g:indexer_ctagsDontSpecifyFilesIfPossible: -1, or maybe 2, and make it default.
   with this value, Indexer should behave with .vimprojects like value is 0, 
   and with .indexer_files like value is 1.
